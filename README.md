# React Based Todo application using ReactJS
This project is a frontend web application initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a solid base for building scalable React applications.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher) → Download Node.js

npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation
Clone the project and install dependencies:

git clone [<your-repo-url>](https://github.com/sureshvel002/todoapp.git)
cd todoapp
npm install

## Run the Project
In the project directory, you can run the following command:

`npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
URL: **http://localhost:3000**

The browser auto-refreshes on file changes.
Console will display any linting issues.

### Test the Project

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Build the Project

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
